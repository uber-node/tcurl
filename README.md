## Installation

`npm install tcurl`

## Examples

### Thrift

For the purposes of these examples, let's assume that you have a TChannel
server listening on `localhost:1234`. The server registers handlers for the
thrift interface saved as `services/chamber.thrift` and defined as:

```thrift
struct EchoRequest {
  1: required string input;
}

service Chamber {
  string echo(
    1: required EchoRequest request;
  )
}
```

You could use TCurl to query this service by running:

```
tcurl -p localhost:1234 chamber Chamber::echo -t ./services -3 '{"request": {"input": "foo"}}'
```

## `localhost` caveat

For TChannel and Hyperbahn to work together effectively, most tchannel services need to listen on the
external IP of the host they are running on.

This means when you use `127.0.0.1` you cannot reach the service with tcurl as it's not listening on
loopback.

To make supporting external IPs easier we've made `localhost` resolve to the external IP of the machine.
This means if your listening on loopback you have to use `127.0.0.1` and not `localhost`

## tcurlrc

TCurl can be configured with default parameters using a either /etc/tcurlrc or
a .tcurlrc in the current working directory or any of its parent directories.
The rc file may be in INI or JSON format.

    {
        "hostlist": "/etc/ringpop/hosts.json"
    }

## Exit Codes

 - 1: timeout
 - 2: cancelled
 - 3: busy
 - 4: declined
 - 5: unexpected error
 - 6: bad request
 - 7: network error
 - 8: unhealthy (broken circuit)
 - 124: unhealthy / not OK thrift response
 - 125: misc tcurl / tchannel internal error
 - 126: response not ok error
 - 127: fatal protocol error
